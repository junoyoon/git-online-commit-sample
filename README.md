git-online-commit-sample
========================

* This is the java sample I created to show how to commit and remove the files in the Git bare repo.
* It's not well known how to manipulate bare repo(git repo without working tree)
* I believe this sample can be used widely who want to embed git in their application.
* it's not maintained.
